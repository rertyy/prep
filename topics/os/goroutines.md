### Goroutines, Coroutines, Process Pools, Task Pools — Relation to Threads/Processes

#### 1. Goroutines (Go)
- **Type**: User-level threads (M:N mapping).
- **Managed by**: Go runtime scheduler, not the OS directly.
- **Mapping**: Many goroutines (M) are multiplexed onto fewer kernel threads (N).
- **Scheduling**: Go’s runtime does work-stealing scheduling across kernel threads.
- **Blocking ops**: Go runtime uses async I/O or parks the goroutine and switches to another.
- **Analogy**: Very lightweight green threads.

**Connection**:  
- Goroutines = **user threads** managed in user space.  
- Backed by **kernel threads** via Go’s runtime (hybrid M:N model).

#### 2. Coroutines (Python, Kotlin, Lua, etc.)
- **Type**: Cooperatively scheduled functions in **user space**.
- **Managed by**: Language runtime (not kernel).
- **Execution**: Single thread executes multiple coroutines by yielding control explicitly (async/await).
- **Parallelism**: None by default → they run **concurrently**, not in parallel (unless multiple threads/processes are used underneath).
- **Analogy**: User-space tasks that take turns, no preemption.

**Connection**:  
- Coroutines = **user-level cooperative threads**.  
- Kernel only sees one thread unless extra threads/processes are used.

---

#### 3. Process Pools
- **Type**: Multiple **OS processes** (not threads).
- **Managed by**: OS kernel + a pool manager in user space (e.g., Python `multiprocessing.Pool`, Java `ProcessBuilder`).
- **Isolation**: Each process has its own memory space.  
- **Overhead**: Higher than threads (context switches, IPC required).  
- **Use case**: CPU-bound tasks → true parallelism without GIL limitations (Python).

**Connection**:  
- Process pools = multiple **kernel processes** managed together.  
- Achieve parallelism via multiple processes instead of threads.

---

#### 4. Task Pools (Thread Pools / Async Task Executors)
- **Type**: A pool of **kernel threads** that pick up work from a queue.
- **Managed by**: Runtime or library (e.g., Java `ExecutorService`, Python `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`).
- **Mapping**: N kernel threads handle M submitted tasks.
- **Scheduling**: The pool assigns tasks to available worker threads.  
- **Use case**: Avoids cost of constantly creating/destroying threads.

**Connection**:  
- Task pools = **kernel threads** reused to execute tasks.  
- User submits lightweight tasks, but execution is still backed by kernel threads.

### Summary Table

| Concept       | Type                        | Managed By        | Mapping to Kernel | Parallelism?       | Notes |
|---------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------|-------|
| **Goroutines**| User threads (M:N)          | Go runtime        | Many → Some KThreads | Yes (runtime schedules across CPUs) | Preemptive scheduling in runtime |
| **Coroutines**| User-space cooperative tasks| Language runtime  | 1:1 with a thread (unless extra) | No (concurrent, not parallel by default) | Yield-based (async/await) |
| **Process Pool** | Processes                | OS kernel         | Each = process    | Yes (true parallelism) | Heavyweight, separate memory |
| **Task Pool** | Tasks on kernel threads     | Pool manager      | Many tasks → Few threads | Yes (depends on threads count) | Typical in Java/Python executors |

### Analogy
- **Goroutines**: A big classroom where many students (goroutines) share a few teachers (kernel threads). The Go runtime decides who gets attention.  
- **Coroutines**: Students politely take turns speaking (cooperative, one at a time).  
- **Process Pool**: Each student has their own private tutor (separate processes).  
- **Task Pool**: A fixed number of teachers (threads) handle a queue of students’ questions (tasks).
