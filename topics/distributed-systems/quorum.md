## Quorum in Distributed Databases
- **Quorum** = Minimum number of nodes that must agree for an operation to succeed.  
- Typically defined with:  
  - `R` = number of replicas required for a read.  
  - `W` = number of replicas required for a write.  
  - `N` = total replicas.  
- Rule of thumb: if **R + W > N**, then reads and writes overlap → ensures **strong consistency**.  
- Trade-offs:  
  - Larger `R` → more consistent reads, but slower.  
  - Larger `W` → stronger write guarantees, but slower.  
  - Smaller values → better performance, but weaker consistency.
