Got it â€” you want to understand **conflict-serializability** in transaction theory. This is a core DB concurrency control concept that connects directly to Postgresâ€™s `SERIALIZABLE` isolation level.

# ðŸ”¹ Conflict Serializability

## 1. **Serializability**

- A **schedule** = interleaving of operations from multiple transactions.
    
- A schedule is **serializable** if it produces the **same result** as some serial (one-after-another) execution of the same transactions.
    

---

## 2. **Conflict Serializability**

- A stronger, easier-to-check condition.
    
- A schedule is **conflict-serializable** if it can be transformed into a serial schedule by swapping **non-conflicting operations**.
    

### Conflicting operations:

Two operations conflict if **all three hold**:

1. Belong to **different transactions**.
    
2. Act on the **same data item**.
    
3. At least one is a **write**.
    

So conflicts are:

- `R1(x)` vs `W2(x)`
    
- `W1(x)` vs `R2(x)`
    
- `W1(x)` vs `W2(x)`

## 3. **Precedence Graph (Serialization Graph)**

- Nodes = transactions.
    
- Edge `Ti â†’ Tj` if `Ti` has an operation that conflicts with and precedes an operation of `Tj`.
    
- The schedule is **conflict-serializable** iff the graph is **acyclic**.
    

---

## 5. **Relation to PostgreSQL SERIALIZABLE**

- Postgres uses **Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI)**, not simple two-phase locking.
    
- It prevents non-serializable schedules by detecting dangerous structures (like cycles in conflict graphs) and aborting one transaction.
    
- This ensures all visible executions are **conflict-serializable**.

## âœ… Summary

- **Serializable** = same outcome as some serial order.
    
- **Conflict-serializable** = can be rearranged to serial order by swapping non-conflicting ops.
    
- **Check**: Build precedence graph â†’ acyclic = conflict-serializable.
    
- **In practice (Postgres)**: SERIALIZABLE isolation enforces conflict-serializability by aborting transactions that would create cycles.
