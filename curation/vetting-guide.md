# Vetting Guide

Use this checklist to curate AI‑generated questions/answers before adding them to role indexes.

## Scope & Relevance
- Matches target roles (backend, fullstack, data‑eng, ML, infra).
- Tests practical skills: design, trade‑offs, debugging, ops, data.

## Correctness
- Technical claims are accurate; conflicting sources resolved.
- Includes counter‑examples or edge cases when relevant.

## Clarity
- Short answer first, deeper detail later; 1–2 code snippets max.
- Interviewer follow‑ups listed; pitfalls called out.

## Links
- Internal: use [[note-links]]; avoid duplicates; prefer kebab‑case.
- External: cite authoritative docs/specs; avoid dead links.

## Action
- If unsure, tag with TODO and add to an inbox note for later review.
