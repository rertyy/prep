# Gossip Protocols

## Question
What are gossip protocols and where are they used?

## Short Answer
Gossip protocols spread state via periodic, random peer exchanges to achieve scalable, eventually consistent dissemination for membership, failure detection, and config distribution.

## Deep Dive
- Epidemic anti‑entropy (push/pull), rumor mongering, TTL.
- Failure detection: SWIM‑style suspicion + indirect probes.
- Convergence speed vs bandwidth trade‑offs.

## Follow‑ups
- Membership in service meshes and databases.
